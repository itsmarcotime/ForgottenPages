## Description
Welcome to the Forgotten Pages application! Make sure to sign up using a email, username, & password! After signing up feel free to create your very own DnD character! The user can create as many charaters as needed and can keep track of all characters using the dashboard. The user will have different options to choose from when creating a character. The only feilds that will be required to be filled in being: name, class, and background.
